Circuit connections (Arduino UNO)
1) Bluetooth (HC-05)

HC-05 is 3.3V logic on RX. Don’t drive it directly with Arduino’s 5V TX — use a simple resistor divider.

HC-05 VCC → 5V

HC-05 GND → GND

HC-05 TXD → Arduino D10 (SoftwareSerial RX)

HC-05 RXD → Arduino D11 through divider:

Arduino D11 ─ 1 kΩ ─┬─> HC-05 RXD

From the junction ─ 2 kΩ ─> GND
(Creates ~3.3 V from Arduino’s 5 V TX)

(If your HC-05 board already has an onboard divider/level shifter, you can connect D11 → RXD directly. Most don’t—use the divider to be safe.)

2) Relay module (5 V, opto-isolated preferred)

Use a 2- or 4-channel 5 V relay module with opto-isolation.

Relay VCC → 5V

Relay GND → GND

Relay IN1 → Arduino D2 (Fan)

Relay IN2 → Arduino D3 (Light)

Relay IN3 → Arduino D4 (Buzzer) (if your module has 3+ channels)

Many relay boards are active-LOW: writing LOW may turn the relay ON.
My code assumes active-HIGH (HIGH = ON). If your board is active-LOW, either invert the pins in code or flip the wiring logic (see “Active-LOW note” below).

3) AC/Load side (⚠️ mains safety)

Each relay has COM, NO, NC terminals.

For each appliance (fan/light/buzzer):

Mains Live (L) → Relay COM

Relay NO → Appliance Live input

Mains Neutral (N) → Appliance Neutral input (direct)

Earth (if present) → Appliance Earth (direct)

NO = Normally Open (appliance OFF until relay energizes).
NC = Normally Closed (appliance ON by default) — usually avoid for safety.

Power & grounding tips

Use the Arduino’s 5 V for HC-05 only (very low current).

Relays draw more current (70–90 mA each). If you use 2–4 relays, it’s best to power the relay board from a separate 5 V supply (e.g., 5 V/1 A).

Common GND is required between Arduino, HC-05, and relay board.

If your relay board has JD-VCC / VCC jumper for opto-isolation:

Remove the jumper,

JD-VCC ← external 5 V for relays,

VCC ← Arduino 5 V for logic,

GNDs must still be common.

Active-LOW relay note (very common)

If your relay turns ON when the Arduino pin is LOW:

In setup(), set all pins HIGH to keep relays OFF at boot:

pinMode(fan, OUTPUT); digitalWrite(fan, HIGH);
pinMode(light, OUTPUT); digitalWrite(light, HIGH);
pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT); digitalWrite(buzzer, HIGH);


In the command handlers, swap HIGH/LOW (e.g., "fan on" → LOW, "fan off" → HIGH).

Voice command examples (Android → HC-05)

fan on, fan off

light on, light off

buzzer on, buzzer off

Use a Bluetooth voice control app (e.g., “Arduino Bluetooth Voice Control”), set delimiter # if you kept that in code, and pair with HC-05 (PIN 1234 or 0000).

Safety checklist (mains voltage)

Work with mains only if you’re trained. Otherwise, ask a qualified person to do the AC wiring.

Use a proper relay module with optical isolation, flyback diodes, and screw terminals.

Place everything in an insulated enclosure; keep low-voltage (Arduino) and mains wires separated.

Add fuses and strain relief for appliance leads.

Never touch or adjust wiring while powered.
